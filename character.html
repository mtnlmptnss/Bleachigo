                <h1>Ichigo Kurosaki</h1>
                <div class="image-container"><img src="./resources/8490f02ffdace4ea90bcbc443ffaede6.jpg" alt="IchigoMain"></div>
                <p>Ichigo Kurosaki (黒崎 一護, Kurosaki Ichigo) is a Human who is also a Substitute Shinigami. Ichigo is the son of Isshin and Masaki Kurosaki, and older brother of Karin and Yuzu. He is also married to Orihime Inoue and has a son named Kazui Kurosaki.</p>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h2>Appearance</h2>
                        <li>
                            <p>Ichigo's most distinguishing feature is his spiky orange hair, a trait he has been ridiculed about for years on end. He is a fairly tall, lean-built young man with peach skin and brown eyes. He likes to wear slim fitting clothes.[10] He has a tendency to wear shirts patterned with the number 15 because his name is a homonym for the number.[11] Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin.[12] When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears the standard Shinigami shihakushō, with the addition of a strap across his chest. Initially, it was a thick brown belt to hold his Zanpakutō sheath, but it later became a red rosary-like strap after awakening his own Shinigami powers.[13] It is shaped like a kite with a flat top and bottom.[14] Ichigo's appearance has caused several people, including Jūshirō Ukitake, to note a similarity to Kaien Shiba, the former lieutenant of the 13th Division.[15] After training in the Dangai, Ichigo's hair grows considerably, and he is noticeably taller, as stated by his friends.[16] After Ichigo loses his Shinigami powers, his appearance reverts to the way it was before his Dangai training.</p>
                            <p>Seventeen months after defeating Aizen, Ichigo's overall appearance does not change, but he becomes taller again and grows sideburns.[18] After regaining his powers, seemingly caused by remaining energy from his Fullbring,[19] Ichigo's Shinigami attire consists of a thicker strap across his chest. He has four black vertical lines on his forearms and black, tattoo-like bands crossing over his chest, wrists, and ankles. Similar bands, but with white ends, lie around his neck as collars.[20]
                                After training at the Soul King Palace, Ichigo wears his standard black shihakushō, but with some notable changes: he has two white shoulder plates crossing his chest in an X shape that hold his Shikai blades in place, with the first plate on his left shoulder having three sections adorned with red scales, the second plate having three sections adorned with red scales on his right waist,[21] and a white cloak with black markings tied around his waist.</p>
                        </li>
                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <li>
                        <p>
                            When he was younger, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world, always smiling when he was with Masaki and regularly holding her hand.[23] Despite crying whenever he lost in a match at the dojo he attended, Ichigo started to smile again as soon as he saw Masaki when she came to pick him up.[24] At a very young age, Ichigo heard his father saying his name means "to protect one thing," which instilled in him a desire to protect his mother. When his sisters were born, he began attending a dojo for the sake of protecting them. Since then, the number of people he wishes to protect has continued to grow, causing Ichigo to risk his life to protect both the people close to him and complete strangers.[25][26][27]
    
                            As a teenager, Ichigo is stubborn, short-tempered, strong-willed, and impulsive.[28][29] Despite claiming not to care about what other people think about him, he attempts to maintain a detached and "cool" image.[30] He generally keeps his face set in a near-permanent scowl, with his eyebrows drawn together.[31] His outspoken, hot-headed demeanor is a trait Ichigo himself has acknowledged, and if somebody picks a fight with him, he cannot help fighting back. He coldly refers to his teachers as "instructors".[32] He is genuinely compassionate and empathetic towards others, promising to bring a Plus flowers[33] and a toy plane,[34] or soothing others when they become upset.[35]
    
                            Ichigo is a capable student, ranked 23rd in his year at school, who studies regularly and does not neglect his schoolwork.[36] He works as hard as he does to overcome the misconceptions many have about him based on his hair color and fighting.[37] Ichigo hates fortune telling, horoscopes, feng shui, psychics, and anyone whose trade involves taking money from people for things they cannot see.[38] He has difficulty remembering people's faces and names.[39][40][41] However, Ichigo can remember the names of noticeable individuals even when they did not directly tell him their names.[42] Ichigo becomes extremely shy and uncomfortable around nude or immodestly dressed women, a fact both Yoruichi Shihōin and Rangiku Matsumoto have teased him for.[43][44][45] Ichigo is often disrespectful when talking to those older than himself, calling Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto "gramps" and referring to several of the Shinigami captains by their given names without using honorifics.[46][47][48][49][50]
    
                            When it comes to fighting, Ichigo has a complex sense of honor; he regularly seeks to exact revenge for the cruel actions of his opponent, such as instilling the fear of being murdered in Shrieker and cutting off the right arm of Yammy Llargo in retaliation for him ripping Yasutora Sado's right arm off.[51][52] He often taunts and belittles his opponents when fighting, sometimes attacking without warning.[53] Ichigo has a strong desire to win his fights, but in what he views as a legitimate manner.[54] To this end, he has often refused the aid of his inner Hollow, even when knowing it would allow him to win.[55] Ichigo's resolve in battle can waver at times, which can impede his fighting prowess, and goes into a state of depression and self-loathing when he loses a major battle or lets a friend down.[56]
    
                            Ichigo despises those who mistreat their allies in any way, even if they are his own enemies. He was disgusted when Yammy calls Ulquiorra Cifer, Nnoitra Gilga, and Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez "trash".

                        </li>
                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <li>
                            <p>Ichigo was born on July 15th as the son of Isshin Kurosaki and Masaki Kurosaki, 15 years before he became a Shinigami. His sisters Karin Kurosaki and Yuzu Kurosaki were born a few years later. When he was four, Ichigo joined a karate dojo, where he met and befriended Tatsuki Arisawa. Though Tatsuki beat Ichigo in every match they had, she would help Ichigo if he was being picked on by bullies and cheer him up if he was upset.[24]
    
                                Ichigo was able to see Pluses for as long as he could remember.[58][59] He could see them so clearly, as a child, he could not tell the living from the dead. This resulted in him appearing to other people to be looking at deserted places and talking to himself. This caused people to say he could see ghosts, though when Tatsuki asked him about this, he denied being able to see them.</p>
                            <p>On June 17th, when Ichigo was nine years old, he and his mother were walking home alongside one of Karakura Town's rivers, which was swollen from heavy rain. Seeing a girl near the river, Ichigo thought she was about to jump into it. Unable to tell the difference between ghosts and living people, Ichigo ran towards her to stop her, unaware the girl was the lure of the Hollow Grand Fisher. Masaki tried to stop him, but he did not listen. After failing to grab hold of the girl, Ichigo lost consciousness for a time. When he awoke, Masaki was lying on top of him, covered in blood.[61] Starting the day after Masaki's death, Ichigo repeatedly skipped school to go to the riverbank where Masaki died. Tatsuki found him there, where he would stay from morning until night, wandering along the bank as if searching for his mother, squatting down if he was tired and then wandering some more.</p>
                            <p>One day, when Ichigo was twelve, prior to the Kurosaki Clinic opening, he heard the bell ring and answered the door to find a girl with her brother on her back. He had been in a car accident and was covered in blood. The clinic did not have the equipment necessary to save him, and he died before an ambulance arrived to transfer him to Karakura Hospital. Sometime later, he learned the girl was Orihime Inoue.[63]
    
                                Ichigo later entered Mashiba Junior High School. During this time, Ichigo finally defeated Tatsuki in a karate match, and had not had another match with her since.[64] Ichigo regularly got into fights with thugs, due to the unusual color of his hair.[32] During one of these fights, he received help from Yasutora Sado. Shortly after, Ichigo returned the favor when he rescued Sado from two gang members roughing him up.[65] When the thugs later abducted Sado, Ichigo found them and knocked down their leader, Yokochini. Using Yokochini's phone to ring for an ambulance for each of the five thugs, he beat up all of them. After Sado was freed, they made a pact to protect and fight for each other.[66]
                                
                                Shortly before Ichigo became a Shinigami, he and Sado began attending Karakura High School, and their reputations preceded them. During a fight with a gang led by Reiichi Ōshima, Ichigo and Sado met Keigo Asano and Mizuiro Kojima, saving the former in the process. While Keigo was initially afraid of Ichigo and Sado, both he and Mizuiro later became friends with them.[67] Ichigo later met Uryū Ishida, asking him why he chose to attend Karakura and not a gifted school, as he would have thought that Uryū would want to follow in his father's footsteps and become a doctor. However, Uryū replied that he had no desire to become one.</p>

                    <div class="image-container"><img src="./resources/d805817b85b1ccad6b454a37dfec2a67.jpg" alt="AizenMain"></div>
                    <p>Sōsuke Aizen (藍染 惣右介, Aizen Sōsuke) is the former captain of the 5th Division in the Gotei 13. He later leaves Soul Society with his followers, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen. His lieutenant was Momo Hinamori. He formerly served as the lieutenant of the 5th Division under Shinji Hirako. After waging war against Soul Society with an army of Arrancar, Aizen was defeated by Ichigo Kurosaki and sealed away by Kisuke Urahara, and then imprisoned for his crimes.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <h2>Appearance</h2>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    When he was a member of the Gotei 13, Aizen appeared as a mild-featured man with brown scholarly hair enhanced by square glasses, along with soft brown eyes. He wore the standard Shinigami uniform with a captain's haori.[3] During his ascent to Hueco Mundo, he removed his glasses and swept his hand through his hair, revealing menacing eyes and a very different hairstyle; his hair is now swept back, with a strand hanging down his face.[4]
    
    In Hueco Mundo, Aizen initially wears Arrancar style-clothes over his shihakushō.[5] After Orihime Inoue is taken to Las Noches, Aizen wears full clothing similar in style to the Arrancar, complete with a pink sash around the waist.[6]
    
    Upon his defeat by Ichigo Kurosaki, Aizen loses all of the physical changes made by his transformation and returns to the physical form he had prior to transforming.[7] While imprisoned in Muken, he wears an almost entirely black outfit with white trimming, a large black eyepatch over his right eye and black boots. A tattered white rag is wrapped around his shoulders.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <h2>Personality</h2>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Aizen is a polite, soft-spoken intellectual, often addressing his subordinates by their given names.[9][10][11][12] He rarely shows any sign of alarm or distress, and often has entire situations planned out well in advance. Whenever confronted, Aizen is casual and uncaring, attempting to draw out a conversation and make small talk, which often infuriates those he is talking to.[13][14][15][16]
    
                                    Aizen initially appeared to be a very kind, well-respected captain and was looked up to by many, especially his lieutenant, Momo Hinamori.[17] However, this was just a mask to disguise his dangerously manipulative nature.[18] In truth, he cares very little for his underlings, and is willing to use almost everyone around him as pawns to achieve his goals. He is willing to stop at nothing to further his ambitions, including manipulating or killing anyone if he deems it necessary.[19][20] He frequently toys with his underlings for amusement.[21][22]
    
                                    During his time as a captain, Aizen liked tofu, but he disliked boiled eggs. In his free time, he often read, and he gave a special lecture of calligraphy at the Shin'ō Academy because he excelled in this branch of arts. This optional course was immensely popular among the Shinigami students, and many of them felt great sorrow at Aizen's sudden departure.[23]
    
                                    As the commander of his army of Arrancar, Aizen controls his minions through acquired respect or fear. Ulquiorra Cifer revealed to Orihime Inoue that they are all there to further Aizen's ambitions.[24] Aizen keeps more rowdy individuals like Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez in line through intimidation and mind games.[25][26] The Arrancar Aisslinger Wernarr claims the Arrancar follow him because he has no fear, something which beings born from fear and despair find inspiring.[27]
    
                                    Gin Ichimaru has some sense of Aizen's emotions and feelings, correctly pointing out Aizen was enjoying the invasion by Ichigo and his friends and their successes within Las Noches, which Aizen himself confirmed,[28] and noting Aizen was surprised by the arrival of Momo during the battle of Fake Karakura Town.[29] In contrast, Kaname Tōsen has shown no such understanding, and has fallen victim to one of Aizen's more minor mind games when Aizen subtly manipulated him into punishing Grimmjow for him while Aizen himself kept up his appearance of benevolence.[30]
    
                                    Aizen's true objective was to overthrow the king of Soul Society. As he and his fellow traitor captains were departing from the Soul Society, he told 13th Division Captain Jūshirō Ukitake "no one has stood on the top of the world", not even the gods, but he aspires to "stand on the heavens and end the unbearable vacancy on the world's throne".[31]
    
                                    According to Kisuke Urahara, since mastering the Hōgyoku, Aizen has become less cautious in battle, for Aizen would not have allowed Urahara to use level 90 Kidō before he subdued the Hōgyoku. Aizen admits his new powers allow him to let his guard down.[32] Due to this newfound power, Aizen has developed an arrogant and overconfident attitude, often not even thinking his attacks or defense through any longer like he used to, or even bothering to find out the effects of his opponents' and his own attacks. In his newest form, he has developed a severe superiority complex, believing he is now above both Shinigami and Hollows.[33] Because of his superior attitude and high intelligence, Aizen is easily enraged when facing something or someone which he does not understand; for example, when witnessing Ichigo Kurosaki use Saigo no Getsuga Tenshō, Aizen becomes furious because he is unable to comprehend how a Human has surpassed him.[34]
    
                                    By the time he is released from Muken, he has reverted to his calm, casual personality, brushing aside Shunsui Kyōraku's praise regarding his current abilities,[35] and somewhat undergoes a change of heart, even being willing to fight against Yhwach and assist Ichigo before returning to Muken.[36] He disagrees with Yhwach's philosophy about combining all three planes of existence to eliminate the fear of death and believes that people would never have the courage to move forward against such a threat in Yhwach's world.

                                    At an unknown point in the past, Aizen became part of the 5th Division under Captain Shinji Hirako.[38] He invested himself in the research and creation of the Hōgyoku even before Kisuke Urahara. To this end, he sacrificed hundreds of Shinigami and hundreds of Rukongai citizens who bore Shinigami talents to his own Hōgyoku, but it was not satisfied with this.[39] At one point, a young Gin Ichimaru watched Aizen meet with three other Shinigami who were kneeling before him. One of the Shinigami handed Aizen the Hōgyoku, prompting Aizen to put the orb in a glass and hand it back to the Shinigami.[40] Aizen and his subordinates left an unconscious Rangiku Matsumoto a short distance away.[41] Aizen eventually caught Shinji's attention, and was promoted to a lieutenant in order for Shinji to watch over him closely,[42] but Shinji's action only helped further the realization of his plans.

                    <p>Kisuke Urahara (浦原 喜助, Urahara Kisuke) is the former captain of the 12th Division, as well as the founder and 1st President of the S.R.D.I.. His lieutenant was Hiyori Sarugaki. He lives in the Human World where he owns a small convenience store which sells Shinigami items. He is assisted by his employees Tessai Tsukabishi, Jinta Hanakari, and Ururu Tsumugiya.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <h2>Appearance</h2>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Kisuke is a tall, lean man with light skin and gray eyes. His hair is messy and light-blond (almost pale), with strands framing the sides of the face and hanging between his eyes, and he has chin stubble. He wears a dark green samue. Over this, he wears a black haori, which sports a white diamond pattern along its bottom half, reminiscent of an inverted captain's haori. Urahara carries a fan, which he occasionally uses to hide his face. He usually wears traditional Japanese wooden sandals (geta) and a striped dark green and white bucket hat (which usually shadows his eyes),[2] which has earned him the nickname "sandal-hat" (ゲタ帽子, geta-bōshi; "Mr. Hat-and-Clogs" in the English dub).
    
                                     years in Soul Society, he had a clean-shaved face and wore the standard Shinigami shihakushō. In his more casual events, he usually wore his geta.[3] He later wore a long-sleeved captain's haori after his promotion to the rank of captain.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <h2>Personality</h2>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Though usually a laid-back, optimistic, jovial, humble and eccentric man, Urahara shows a deceptively cunning and serious side when the situation warrants it. He commonly uses idle conversation and outward concern to distract his opponents.[5] Despite his care-free attitude, he always speaks politely, but is sometimes sarcastic. Yoruichi Shihōin notes he tends to go over the top with whatever he becomes passionate about. He has described himself as a "mere honest, handsome, perverted businessman."
    
                                    Approximately 110 years ago, Urahara's personality was slightly opposite of what it is in the present. During his earlier years as a captain, he was viewed as a nervous, flustered, and quiet person. Somewhat unsure of himself, he lacked confidence in his ability to be a good leader. In addition, he was occasionally confused with how to deal with his division. Despite being uncomfortable in his role, he seemed relatively at ease in his previous position at the 2nd Division Detention Unit. However, he eventually hardened his resolve to take on his role as captain by becoming more serious and determined.
    
                                    Urahara can usually be found near the scene of an important event, but he rarely intervenes in situations, preferring to stay on the sidelines. He often knows more information than he lets on, and despite being a major player in the situation, he acts only as a catalyst, having others do the work for him. Urahara is often manipulative, tricking people into doing what he wants them to.

                                    Kisuke is a pragmatic combatant, believing that using any means necessary in a life-and-death battle is essential in victory and survival, such as forming an alliance with Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez beforehand to defeat Askin Nakk Le Vaar via a sneak attack from behind.

                                    Urahara grew up at the Shihōin Mansion in Seireitei with his childhood friends Yoruichi Shihōin and Tessai Tsukabishi.[7] He joined the Gotei 13 around the same time Yoruichi joined the Onmitsukidō,[3] and eventually became the 3rd Seat of the 2nd Division, which was intertwined with the Onmitsukidō. As part of his duties as one of the top five Seated Officers, Urahara became head of the Onmitsukidō's Detention Unit.[8] Approximately 110 years ago, the 12th Division captain, Kirio Hikifune, was promoted to the Royal Guard,[9] and Yoruichi recommended Urahara as her replacement.
